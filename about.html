                                Since the completion of our church building, Northwood has put forth a concerted effort toward outreach.  Locally, recent outreach efforts include Blanket Buddies (Fleece yard goods are collected and made into blankets, hats, mittens and scarfs and given to those in need.), monthly themed giving to the Carlton County Food Shelf through the Salvation Army of Cloquet, monthly opportunities to volunteer in the Damiano Center Soup Kitchen, and a collection for the Friends of Animals Humane Society of Carlton County.  Nationally, a group of youth and adults from Northwood have gone down to New Orleans in June of 2009 on a mission trip, we have collected boxes for soldiers and sent money to hurricane victims.  Globally, we have particpated in Operation Christmas Shoebox.
