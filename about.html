                                    Ours is a young and growing country church, established in 1983.  We serve families in Esko, Cloquet, Carlton and other surrounding communities.

                                    Since the completion of our church building, Northwood has put forth a concerted effort toward outreach.  Locally, recent outreach efforts have include Blanket Buddies (Fleece yard goods are collected and made into blankets, hats, mittens and scarfs and given to those in need.) and contribute to the Minnesota March Food Drive through the Carlton County Food Shelf, Nationally, a group of youth and adults from Northwood have gone down to New Orleans in June of 2009 on a mission trip, we have collected boxes for soldiers and sent money to hurricane victims.  Globally, we have participated in Operation Christmas Shoebox and are currently planning for a mission trip to the Rio Bravo Mission Trip in December of 2015 with Crossroads Church.
