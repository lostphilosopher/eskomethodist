                    Ours is a young and growing country church, established in 1983.  We serve families in Esko, Cloquet, Carlton and other surrounding communities.

                    Since the completion of our church building, Northwood has put forth a concerted effort toward outreach. Locally, recent outreach efforts have included Blanket Buddies (Fleece yard goods are collected and made into blankets, hats, mittens and scarfs and given to those in need.) and contributions to the Minnesota March Food Drive through the Carlton County Food Shelf. Nationally, a group of youth and adults from Northwood went to New Orleans in June of 2009 on a mission trip and  we are currently planning for a mission trip to the Rio Bravo Mission in December of 2015 with Crossroads Church. Globally, we have participated in Operation Christmas Shoebox, collected boxes for soldiers, and sent money to hurricane victims.
