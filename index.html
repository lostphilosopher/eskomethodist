                <p>We are a small church looking to expand in our mission and vision. We welcome everyone who walks through our doors in search of a relationship with Jesus Christ. We currently provide a Sunday morning worship service at 9 AM, a time of fellowship after the service and pre-school thru adult Sunday school from 10:30 - 11:30. We provide monthly fellowship opportunities and services to the surrounding communities of Esko, Cloquet, Carlton and Duluth. We are looking to broaden and deepen our individual relationships with Christ through a variety of special seasonal worhip opportunites. Ours is an open communion table and everyone is welcome to take communion which we offer on the first Sunday (usually) of the month. YOU ARE INVITED TO JOIN US - THERE IS A PLACE FOR YOU!</p>

                <p>Pastor Gary Gottfried was born in Indiana and attended seminary at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston, Il. He has roots in Minnesota as a graduate of the University of Minnesota where he studied social work. While he did become a pastor after seminary, he spent more than a decade in the 90s serving as a social worker, financial adviser, and professional fundraiser. Thankfully for Northwood he returned to the ministry in 2007 accepting a position at Tracy United Methodist Church. Pastor Gottfried served several Minnesota churches before coming to Northwood (and our sister church Norton Park) in 2013. </p>
                <p>Pastor Gottfried brings his experience in the ministry and a passion for Christ to the pulpit every Sunday. He preaches the Gospel and calls the church to the love of God and service to our neighbors.</p>
                <p>Pastor Gottfried's wife Eugenie is also a big part of the church and its ministry. A talented pianist; she often plays on Sundays and for special services. She also leads the Northwood choir. </p>
