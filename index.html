                <p>We are a small church looking to expand in our mission and vision. We welcome everyone who walks through our doors in search of a relationship with Jesus Christ. We currently provide a Sunday morning worship service at 9 AM, a time of fellowship after the service and pre-school thru adult Sunday school from 10:30 - 11:30. We provide monthly fellowship opportunities and services to the surrounding communities of Esko, Cloquet, Carlton and Duluth. We are looking to broaden and deepen our individual relationships with Christ through a variety of special seasonal worhip opportunites. Ours is an open communion table and everyone is welcome to take communion which we offer on the first Sunday (usually) of the month. YOU ARE INVITED TO JOIN US - THERE IS A PLACE FOR YOU!</p>

                <p>I have been a pastor in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America since 1999. My first congregation was Elim Lutheran Church in Barnum, then I served Salem Lutheran Church in Hermantown. From there I moved to Wisconsin to serve Bethany Lutheran Church in Mauston. At that time I took the intentional interim ministry training and was certified as an Interim Pastor.</p>
                <p>I then returned to my beloved Minnesota to serve as Intentional Interim Pastor to Salem in Deerwood, and I completed my second interim with Bethesda Lutheran in Carlton in December 2016. Throughout all my ministry I have enjoyed working with children, and have developed about a dozen puppets that I use during childrenâ€™s time in worship. A favorite of adults and children alike is Bobcat, who is rather snarky and self-centered, but a softie at heart.</p>
                <p>My husband Paul, to whom I have been married since 1990, works for Northwoods Children Center in Duluth. We have one child, Katie, who lives in St. Paul and is working on her Masters of Social Work at the University of Minnesota.</p>
                <p>Our family also includes two dogs, one cat and a horse. My favorite pastimes are knitting, reading, motorcycling, and horseback riding. </p>
                <p>It is so good to join you as your Intentional Interim Pastor. I am looking forward to meeting you, learning about your unique gifts, and discerning with you where God is calling you at this time.</p>
